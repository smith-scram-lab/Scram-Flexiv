
# Safety Protocol for Flexiv Rizon 4 Robot

## General Safety Guidelines
1. **Emergency Stop and Motion Bar**:
   - Ensure that the **motion bar** is always **held** by an operator during robot operation. This allows for immediate access to the **emergency stop** and other control functions.
   - The **emergency stop button** should be **easily accessible** and **tested regularly**. Train all users on how to **activate the emergency stop** in case of an emergency.

2. **Work Area Clearance**:
   - Keep the robot's **workspace clear** of any **obstacles**, **tools**, or other objects that could interfere with the robot's movement or pose a hazard.

3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Perform a **risk assessment** for each new task or setup to identify potential hazards and implement necessary safety measures.

## Operating the Robot
1. **Powering On the System**:
   - Ensure the **emergency stop** is **engaged**.
   - **Turn on** the **teach pendant** before powering on the robot.
   - Ensure there is **nothing in the gripper** before starting up the robot, as the gripper will **move during startup**.
   - Turn on the **power switch** on the control box. Wait for the **indicator light strips** to illuminate.
   - **Release the emergency stop** only after the **indicator light strips** are on.
   - Follow the **start-up procedures** as instructed on the **teach pendant**.

2. **Manual Mode Operation**:
   - When operating the robot in **manual mode**, ensure the **slide switch** is in the **lower position** on the motion bar.
   - Use the **teach pendant** to guide the robot’s movements, keeping an eye on potential obstacles.

3. **Automatic Mode Operation**:
   - Before switching to **automatic mode**, verify that the robot’s path is **clear of obstacles** and other personnel.
   - Use **safety barriers** or **light curtains** where necessary to protect the workspace.

4. **Emergency Procedures**:
   - If an **error** or **unexpected movement** occurs, immediately **press the emergency stop button** on the motion bar.
   - Follow the **error recovery procedures** as instructed on the **teach pendant**.

## Gripper Safety
1. **Gripper Configuration**:
   - Ensure the gripper is **properly mounted** and **connected**.
   - **Calibrate** the gripper as needed before use.

2. **Operating the Gripper**:
   - Set appropriate **force** and **speed parameters** to prevent damage to the gripper or the objects being manipulated.
   - Regularly **check the gripper** for wear and tear.
   - Ensure the gripper **releases any objects** it is holding before **shutting down the robot** to prevent damage to both the gripper and the objects.

## Auto Mode Safety
 
### Importance of Abiding by Auto-Mode Safety Protocol
Adhering to the auto-mode safety protocols is crucial for several reasons:
   - **Preventing Accidents**: Auto-mode allows the robot to operate autonomously and at full speed, which increases the risk of accidents if proper precautions are not taken. Ensuring the area is clear and using safety barriers helps prevent unintended collisions.
   - **Quick Response to Errors**: Continuous monitoring and easy access to the emergency stop ensure that any errors or unexpected behaviors can be quickly addressed, minimizing potential damage and ensuring operator safety.
   - 
1. **Pre-Check**:
   - **Ensure the work area** is clear of any **obstacles** and personnel before initiating auto-mode.
   - **Verify** that the robot's programmed path does not interfere with any objects or barriers.

2. **Use Safety Barriers**:
   - **Implement safety barriers** or **light curtains** around the robot's operating area to prevent unauthorized access during auto-mode operations.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - **Continuously monitor** the robot during auto-mode to quickly respond to any errors or unexpected behaviors.
   - Have an **operator present** who is familiar with the emergency stop procedures.
     
4. **Programming**:
   - **Step through** the program in 10% speed before putting the code into use.
   - If anything unexpected happens, engage the **Emergency Stop** immediately.
     
5. **Emergency Stop**:
   - **Ensure the emergency stop button** is easily accessible at all times and test it regularly.
   - **Train all operators** on how to engage the emergency stop if an issue arises during auto-mode.

## Maintenance and Inspection
1. **Regular Inspections**:
   - Conduct regular **inspections** of the robot, gripper, and associated equipment to check for signs of **wear**, **damage**, or **malfunction**.
   - **Replace** or **repair** any damaged components immediately.

2. **Cleaning**:
   - Keep the robot and workspace **clean** and free from **dust** and **debris**.
   - Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for **cleaning** and **maintenance** procedures.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Keep detailed **records** of all **maintenance activities**, **inspections**, and any **incidents** that occur.

## Training and Authorization
1. **Operator Training**:
   - Every user must go through the **_Flexiv Rizon Quick Start Guide_** under the supervision of a trained person.
   - Ensure all operators receive **comprehensive training** on the safe use of the Flexiv Rizon 4 robot, including **start-up**, **operation**, **emergency procedures**, and **maintenance**.

3. **Authorization**:
   - Only **trained** and **authorized personnel** are allowed to operate the robot. **Unauthorized use** is strictly prohibited.

By adhering to these safety protocols, we can ensure a **safe** and **productive** environment when using the Flexiv Rizon 4 robot. **Safety** is our top priority, and all team members must follow these guidelines diligently.
